This notebook provides the Python implementation of a biophysically realistic AdEx mean-field model proposed for a reward-driven consequential decision-making task. The implementation in Python, code writing and the preparation of the Jupyter notebook was done by Emre Baspinar. The model design was contributed by Emre Baspinar, Gloria Cecchini (U. of Barcelona), Rub√©n Moreno Bote (Pompeu Fabra University, Barcelona), Ignasi Cos (U. of Barcelona) and Alain Destexhe (CNRS, NeuroPSI, Paris-Saclay). This work was supported by Human Brain Project (European Union grant H2020-945539).

This notebook is updated regularly. Please feel free to contact if you have any feedback.
